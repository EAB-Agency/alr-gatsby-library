                When applying to a graduate or professional program at Bear
                University, keep in mind that each graduate school, center, or
                instituteâ€”and their individual departments and programs in many
                casesâ€”determines its own application requirements.
              </p>
              <p>
                Take a moment to visit Graduate Admissions for a general
                introduction to applying to BU and be sure to reach out to the
                admissions counselors at your school and program of interest if
                you have questions.
